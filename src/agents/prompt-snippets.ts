<skills_protocol>
Skills are methodology payloads (step-by-step execution blueprints).

- If you were delegated work without the methodology you need, load exactly ONE relevant skill via the skill tool.
- If the skill tool is unavailable in your toolset, explicitly name the skill(s) you would use and why, so the delegator can re-run with task(load_skills=[...]).
- Avoid loading many skills at once. Prefer 1-2 skills total and split work into smaller delegations when needed.
