# No checklists needed - this task creates research prompts, validation is built into the research methodology

### 1. YOLO Mode - Fast, Autonomous (0-1 prompts)

- Autonomous decision making with logging
- Minimal user interaction
- *Best for:** Simple, deterministic tasks

### 2. Interactive Mode - Balanced, Educational (5-10 prompts) **[DEFAULT]**

- Explicit decision checkpoints
- Educational explanations
- *Best for:** Learning, complex decisions

### 3. Pre-Flight Planning - Comprehensive Upfront Planning

- Task analysis phase (identify all ambiguities)
- Zero ambiguity execution
- *Best for:** Ambiguous requirements, critical work

*Parameter:** `mode` (optional, default: `interactive`)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

*Purpose:** Definitive pass/fail criteria for task completion

*Checklist:**

```yaml
acceptance-criteria:
  - [ ] Resource exists and is valid; no duplicate resources created
    type: acceptance-criterion
    blocker: true
    validation: |
      Assert resource exists and is valid; no duplicate resources created
    error_message: "Acceptance criterion not met: Resource exists and is valid; no duplicate resources created"
```

---

## Error Handling

*Strategy:** retry

*Common Errors:**

1. *Error:** Resource Already Exists
   - *Cause:** Target file/resource already exists in system
   - *Resolution:** Use force flag or choose different name
   - *Recovery:** Prompt user for alternative name or force overwrite

2. *Error:** Invalid Input
   - *Cause:** Input name contains invalid characters or format
   - *Resolution:** Validate input against naming rules (kebab-case, lowercase, no special chars)
   - *Recovery:** Sanitize input or reject with clear error message

3. *Error:** Permission Denied
   - *Cause:** Insufficient permissions to create resource
   - *Resolution:** Check file system permissions, run with elevated privileges if needed
   - *Recovery:** Log error, notify user, suggest permission fix
