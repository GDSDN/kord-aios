# Audit Tailwind v4 Configuration & Utility Health

### 1. YOLO Mode - Fast, Autonomous (0-1 prompts)

- Autonomous decision making with logging
- Minimal user interaction
- *Best for:** Simple, deterministic tasks

### 2. Interactive Mode - Balanced, Educational (5-10 prompts) **[DEFAULT]**

- Explicit decision checkpoints
- Educational explanations
- *Best for:** Learning, complex decisions

### 3. Pre-Flight Planning - Comprehensive Upfront Planning

- Task analysis phase (identify all ambiguities)
- Zero ambiguity execution
- *Best for:** Ambiguous requirements, critical work

*Parameter:** `mode` (optional, default: `interactive`)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

*Purpose:** Definitive pass/fail criteria for task completion

*Checklist:**

```yaml
acceptance-criteria:
  - [ ] Analysis accurate; all targets covered; report complete
    type: acceptance-criterion
    blocker: true
    validation: |
      Assert analysis accurate; all targets covered; report complete
    error_message: "Acceptance criterion not met: Analysis accurate; all targets covered; report complete"
```

## Error Handling

*Strategy:** fallback

*Common Errors:**

1. *Error:** Target Not Accessible
   - *Cause:** Path does not exist or permissions denied
   - *Resolution:** Verify path and check permissions
   - *Recovery:** Skip inaccessible paths, continue with accessible ones

2. *Error:** Analysis Timeout
   - *Cause:** Analysis exceeds time limit for large codebases
   - *Resolution:** Reduce analysis depth or scope
   - *Recovery:** Return partial results with timeout warning

3. *Error:** Memory Limit Exceeded
   - *Cause:** Large codebase exceeds memory allocation
   - *Resolution:** Process in batches or increase memory limit
   - *Recovery:** Graceful degradation to summary analysis

## Description

Review Tailwind CSS v4 setup to guarantee @theme layering, content scanning, utility hygiene, and performance baselines are correct. Produces remediation plan and metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Tailwind v4 installed (or upgrade plan underway)
- Access to codebase for static analysis
- Ability to run Tailwind build locally

## Workflow

1. *Collect Context**
   - Locate primary CSS entry (`app.css`, `src/styles.css`, etc.)
   - Identify additional `@imports`, custom utilities, plugins
   - Read `.state.yaml` for current Tailwind metadata (if available)

2. *Validate @theme Layers**
   - Ensure tokens defined within `@theme` grouped as core → semantic → component
   - Confirm dark mode overrides (`[data-theme="dark"]`) map to semantic tokens
   - Check no residual `theme.extend` references exist

3. *Inspect @layer Usage**
   - `@layer base`: Resets, typography, `focus-visible`
   - `@layer components`: Reusable abstractions (e.g., `.form-label`)
   - `@layer utilities`: Custom utility definitions with `@utility`
   - Verify ordering (base → components → utilities) and duplication avoidance

4. *Content & Purge Coverage**
   - Review Tailwind CLI entry for `content` globs (JIT purge)
   - Ensure glob coverage includes `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.mdx`, Storybook stories, templates
   - Flag false negatives (classes generated dynamically) and propose safelist

5. *Utility Health Scan**
   - Run class collision detection (tailwind-merge or eslint-plugin-tailwindcss)
   - Identify redundant custom utilities replaced by tokens/variants
   - Detect legacy classes (e.g., `outline-none` instead of `outline-hidden`)

6. *Performance Snapshot**
   - Record build metrics (cold + incremental)
   - Capture CSS bundle size, number of utilities generated
   - Compare with target benchmarks (Oxide reference)

7. *Report & Remediation**
   - Summarize findings (pass/warn/fail) in `docs/reports/tailwind-audit.md`
   - Provide prioritized action list (tokens to add, utilities to remove, config fixes)
   - Update `.state.yaml` with audit timestamp, benchmark data, outstanding actions

## Output

- Audit report (`docs/reports/tailwind-audit.md`)
- Updated `.state.yaml` under `tooling.tailwind` (validation + metrics)
- Optional lint/config patches (ESLint Tailwind rules, Prettier plugin settings)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `@theme` defines full token stack with no missing categories
- [ ] `@layer` usage consistent and free of duplicate definitions
- [ ] Content paths cover 100% of templates (no orphaned utilities)
- [ ] tailwind-merge/eslint scans zero conflicts or all logged issues resolved
- [ ] Build metrics captured (cold/incremental) and comparable to prior baseline
- [ ] Recommendations documented with owners + due dates
- [ ] `.state.yaml` updated (`tailwind_theme_validated: true/false`) and audit timestamp logged

## Notes

- Encourage automated linting (ESLint + prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) post-audit
- Document class naming conventions (order: layout → size → spacing → typography → color → effect)
- Track manual overrides (safelist patterns, arbitrary values) for future cleanup
