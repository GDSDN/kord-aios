# Personalized Workflow Template Notes

Use this file to document workflow-specific conventions when creating custom workflows.

## Conventions
- Keep steps sequential unless parallel execution is explicitly supported.
- Ensure each step lists the agent, task, and validation criteria.
- Store workflow outputs in a standard execution report format.
